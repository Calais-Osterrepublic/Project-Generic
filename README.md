# Generico Ruleset
The most raw ruleset; the most simple playable "gamemode" I can imagine

Built directly off of Monokiro's Origins, but isn't primarily focused on the design philosophy of that mod(I'm on my way to making a mod like that though).

The Primary focus is to provide a stripped down framework where I can work on develop my theory on modding. 

Use at your leisure via the Import Repository method.
